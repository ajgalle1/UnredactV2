# UnredactV2

Introducing the FOIA Hero, a cutting-edge web application designed to support FOIA officers in ensuring the accuracy and completeness of their responses.

Why it matters
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a foundational document in American democracy, laying out the government's commitment to transparency. It is often quoted that "democracy dies in the dark," and FOIA is the leading mechanism that ensures confidence in open, accountable governance.
However, not all information is open for public inspection, such as trade secrets, certain Personally Identifiable Information, or military capabilities and plans. A FOIA analyst must be vigilant in keeping secrets secret.

Complicating matters, reports of bot driven FOIA requests threaten to overburden the already strained agencies.

FOIA Hero helps civil servants in fulfilling their obligations to promote transparency while safeguarding sensitive material.  

Key Features:
Automated Error Detection: Leverages Azure AI Language services and Vision Services to meticulously process and analyze FOIA officer work, flagging potentially ineffective redactions, inadvertent PII leaks, and more.

Real-Time Feedback: Receive instant feedback and suggestions for corrections, allowing FOIA officers to make necessary adjustments quickly and efficiently.

Comprehensive Reporting: Generate detailed reports that highlight areas of concern and track improvements over time, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.
